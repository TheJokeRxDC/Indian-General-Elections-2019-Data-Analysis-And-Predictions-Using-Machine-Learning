    "<p> The 2019 Indian general election was held in seven phases from 11 April to 19 May 2019 to constitute the 17th Lok Sabha. The votes were counted, and the result was declared on 23 May. About 911 million people were eligible to vote, and voter turnout was over 67 percent – the highest ever and the highest ever participation by women voters.\n",
    "The Bharatiya Janata Party won 303 seats, further increasing its substantial majority, and the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) won 353 seats. The BJP won 37.36% of votes, while the NDA's combined ballot was 45% of the 60.37 crore votes that were polled. The Indian National Congress won just 52 seats, and the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance won 91. Other parties and their alliances won 98 seats. </p>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<p> In this notebook, I have used data visualization tools such as Matplotlib, Plotly, and Seaborn to visualize how India's people voted during the 2019 elections. I have also experimented with Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine, and K-Nearest Neighbor machine learning models to make predictions. The models' hyperparameters were first tuned manually, and then GridSearchCV was used to find the most optimum results. I have also evaluated the performance metrics of these models and compared them with each other. </p>"

This is the highest vote share received by the party nation-wide in any Lok Sabha election since the party was (re)formed in 1980. In contrast, the Congress party failed to improve on its vote share from 2014 and gathered 20.2% of the total votes. The dominant victory of the BJP and its allies — by repeating the 2014 win, and then some — suggests that the era of coalitions (and/or a central government with a relatively weak national party in power) determining the balance of power at Delhi has decisively come to an end."

    "**Amethi (Uttar Pradesh):** Known to be a traditional Congress bastion, BJP had fielded Union Minister Smriti Irani against Congress president Rahul Gandhi. The voting day in Amethi in the fifth phase was marked by charges of 'booth-rigging' by Irani and Congress president Rahul Gandhi being absent from the constituency. In 2014, Irani lost to Rahul Gandhi from the same seat with a vote-margin of 1.07 lakh votes or a vote-ratio of about 3:4. This time, her challenge has forced Rahul Gandhi to also seek election from Wayanad.\n",

    "**Varanasi (Uttar Pradesh):** Given the significance of the seat, mid-polls rumours had emerged that the Congress' General Secretary for Uttar Pradesh East Priyanka Gandhi Vadra could contest the seat. However, the speculations were put to rest as Congress fielded Ajay Rai, hours before PM Modi addressed a massive road-show ahead of his nomination-filing. In the 2014 Parliamentary elections, PM Modi swept the seat by receiving 56.40% of votes and defeated Arvind Kejriwal by a by 3.37 lakh vote margin.\n",

    "**West Bengal:** West Bengal remained the newsmaker of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, with violence including crude bombs, lathi charges and repeated political clashes and claims of attacks from candidates became the talking point in the state as polling was held in all seven phases spread across two months in the politically important state. Bengal has 42 Lok Sabha constituencies, of which the Trinamool won 34 in 2014. The Congress managed four and the Left two. The BJP secured only two, despite the Narendra Modi wave in the country that year. The state which was considered to be a bastion for the Left Wing has now become a stronghold for the Trinamool Congress.\n",

    "The Trinamool Congress recorded its best-ever performance in 2014 Lok Sabha election in West Bengal as it swept 34 of the 42 seats decimating the Left in its victory march, while the BJP made impressive inroads winning two seats. The BJP left no stone unturned in attempting to make inroads into Mamata Banerjee's bastion while the Trinamool responded by not ceding an inch. This time around BJP swept the 2019 Lok Sabha polls winning 18 seats out of 42 with a vote share of 41.6%. However it failed to dent the consolidated vote share of Mamata Banerjee's TMC."

    "**Begusarai (Bihar):** The Begusarai constituency, which is among the most talked about seats in Bihar, recorded a comparatively high turnout of 61.27%, as per the EC. The constituency has been under a microscope as it is witnessing the electoral debut of CPI candidate Kanhaiya Kumar, the controversial former JNUSU president who is pitted against BJP leader and union minister Giriraj Singh. The Mahagathbandhan's nominee is Tanweer Hasan (RJD).\n",

    "**Bangalore South (Karnataka)**: The saffron bastion will see BJP's Tejasvi Surya take on Congress’ BK Hariprasad. After the untimely death of BJP leader and union minister Ananth Kumar who had held the constituency since 1996, BJP has fielded a young face in Tejasvi Surya. The late Ananth Kumar had beaten Infosys co-founder Nandan Nilekani, then a Congress candidate, in 2014.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Wayanad (Kerala):** Congress chief Rahul Gandhi contesting from this constituency apart from Congress' bastion in Amethi has made the relatively new seat becoming a national talking point. Against him are PP Suneer of CPI(M) and Thushar Vellappally of Bharath Dharma Jana Sena (an ally of BJP). Interestingly, Congress chief will be fighting with three namesakes: two Independent candidates, K.E. Rahul Gandhi and K.M. Shivprasad Gandhi, and K. Raghul Gandhi of the Agila India Makkal Kazhagam party.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bhopal (Madhya Pradesh):** A BJP bastion, this constituency has taken centrestage ever since the BJP fielded Malegaon blast-accused Sadhvi Pragya from the seat against Congress veteran Digvijaya Singh. Singh has been CM of Madhya Pradesh and is contesting an election after a gap of almost 19 years, the last being the assembly election he contested in 2003. He was nominated to the Rajya Sabha in 2014 from Madhya Pradesh. The BJP however has consistently been winning the seat of Bhopal since 1989. BJP's Alok Sanjar is the sitting MP from the Bhopal Lok Sabha seat. What makes the contest especially interesting, however, is the fact that Digvijaya Singh was one of the most significant proposers of 'Saffron terror/Hindu terror' which cited the Malegaon blasts among others.\n",
